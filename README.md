This Docker image is based on the remnux/metasploit docker image, but including a framework and operating system update each time that it is build.

Most lines below are copied from the remnux/metasploit Dockerfile.

This Docker image encapsulates [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) software for penetration testing. To run this image after installing Docker, use a command like this:

    sudo  docker run --rm -it -p 443:443 -v ~/.msf4:/root/.msf4 -v /tmp/msf:/tmp/data jselvi/metasploit

The `-p` parameter exposes the ports on which you expect to receive inbound connections from reverse shells and such. Once the app starts, run the desired Metasploit command, such as "msfconsole" inside its container.

After running the image, you'll have files from your Metasploit session in the ~/.msf4 and /tmp/msf directories on your host. The next time you run the app, it will pick up from where it left off by reading the files in those locations. If you wish to start from scratch, remove those directories (`sudo rm -rf ~/.msf4 /tmp/msf`).

In addition to including Metasploit Framework, the image also includes [Nmap](https://nmap.org), [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/) and [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/).
