# This Docker image is based on the remnux/metasploit docker image, but including a
# framework and operating system update each time that it is build.
#
# Most lines below are copied from the remnux/metasploit Dockerfile.
#
# This Docker image file encapsulates Metasploit Framework, which is distributed
# from https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework
#
# To run this image after installing Docker, use a command like this:
#
# sudo docker run --rm -it -p 443:443 -v ~/.msf4:/root/.msf4 -v /tmp/msf:/tmp/data jselvi/metasploit
#
# The -p parameter exposes the ports on which you expect to receive inbound connections from
# reverse shells and such. Once the app starts, run the desired Metasploit command, such as
# "msfconsole" inside its container.
#
# After running the image, you'll have files from your Metasploit session in the ~/.msf4 and
# /tmp/msf directories on your host. The next time you run the app, it will pick up from where
# it left off by reading the files in those locations. If you wish to start from scratch,
# remove those directories ("sudo rm -rf ~/.msf4 /tmp/msf").
#
# In addition to including Metasploit Framework, the image also includes Nmap and tmux.
